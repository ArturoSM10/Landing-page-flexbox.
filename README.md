Landing page using Flexbox.

This is one of the projects of TOP, it asked you to make a similar page to some images. It helped me to understand how to use flexbox and its 
disadvantages, i also made the cards section different so i learned about position relative and absolute and understand about the responsive web design and why it is a problem in web development.




What it  is used:

-Html
-CSS 
    -Flexbox.
    -Position Absolute and relative.
    -transform and transition.
    -max and mins.
